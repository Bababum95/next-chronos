### Files Initially Marked as Unused (But Actually Used)
The following files were initially identified as unused but manual verification revealed they are actually being used:

- UI Components: Most are used through barrel exports
- Feature Components: Many are imported through feature index files
- Utility Functions: Used across multiple files through barrel exports

## Key Insights

1. **Complex Dependency Graph**: The codebase has a complex dependency structure due to:
   - Barrel exports (index.ts files)
   - Feature-based architecture
   - Shared UI components
   - Cross-module dependencies

2. **Conservative Approach Needed**: Manual verification is essential because:
   - Many components are used through indirect imports
   - Barrel exports make dependency tracking complex
   - Next.js conventions add additional complexity

3. **Build Safety**: The project builds successfully after cleanup, confirming that only truly unused files were removed.

## Recommendations

1. **Use Automated Tools**: Tools like `ts-unused-exports` and `ts-prune` can help identify unused exports more safely
2. **Incremental Cleanup**: Remove files one at a time and test builds
3. **Focus on Dead Code**: Remove unused exports within files rather than entire files
4. **Manual Review**: Always verify dependencies before removing files

## Tools for Further Cleanup

- `ts-unused-exports`: Find unused exports
- `ts-prune`: Find unused exports and dead code
- `unimported`: Find unused files and dependencies
- `eslint-plugin-unused-imports`: Remove unused imports
